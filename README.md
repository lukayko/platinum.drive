# platinum.drive

A fictional car rental webapp that I decided to build as a representation of my front end skills. I decided to go for car rental as I love cars and I felt that a webapp like this would be a good example of a real life project.

## See the live project

You can checkout the live project [HERE](https://64e7a820f4e89b04f81127ce--iridescent-snickerdoodle-087582.netlify.app/)

## How to run the project?

Currently the website is in a stage when it is able to be booted on local server. There are plans to host it on a domain but that's something that I'm considering after I finish the planned tasks for this year. Currently, it is needed to download the project and run it locally.

Follow these steps after you clone the project to run it locally:

    npm install .
    // Then run it in dev mode
    npm run dev

User should be able to navigate through the site and see the available car fleet of platinum.drive. What's more, user can read more about a specific car and book it. During the booking process user can decide for the date range and chauffeur services which come at additional costs. User can also see, the final price of the rental.

## Technologies used in this project

- React 18.2
- React Router 6.1
- Tailwind CSS 3.3.2
- Typescript 5.0.2
- Formik 2.2.9
- Yup 1.1.1
- Date-fns 2.3
- Vite 4.3.2

I decided for React.js and Typescript to learn the industry standard. I'm planning to migrate the project to Next.js to be able to do work on the back-end in the future. I would love to make the car reservation system working, however I didn't set a specific date for that feature.
